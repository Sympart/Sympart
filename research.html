        <p> Under the mentorship of <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/myncbi/18A7NxjvliHAe/bibliography/public/" target="_blank"> Dr. Umashankar Singh</a>, Principal Investigator of the <a href="https://sites.google.com/iitgn.ac.in/homecelllabiitgn/home?authuser=0" target="_blank"> HoMeCell </a> Lab at IIT Gandhinagar, I am currently immersed in my M.Tech thesis work. My focus lies on the meticulous screening of regulatory elements, primarily enhancer elements, nestled within the expansive open chromatin regions of the human genome. Leveraging publicly available datasets corresponding to ATAC Seq and DNase Seq, I am meticulously sifting through these regions in search of key elements. </p>
        <p> Of particular interest to me is the identification of regulatory elements within these regions that are governed by CGG Binding Protein 1 (CGGBP1). Renowned for its pivotal role in gene expression and cell cycle regulation, CGGBP1 plays a crucial role in orchestrating essential functions within the human genome. To achieve my objectives, I am harnessing the power of various computational tools tailored to the field of biology.</p>

        <p>CRISPR has captivated the scientific community for its pivotal role in genetic engineering, offering precise gene modification capabilities. My intrigue lies in unraveling the evolutionary origins of this mechanism. Little is understood about the adaptive immunity techniques in prokaryotes, particularly the signaling pathways that initiate and orchestrate adaptive immunity within bacteria. Currently, I am delving into the intricacies of bacterial signaling upon encountering pathogens or foreign particles, unraveling the intricate protection pathways that ensue. </p>
        <p>In tandem with this exploration, I am deeply engrossed in deciphering the selection and evolution of spacer elements within bacterial genomes, elucidating the mechanisms that confer specificity during immune responses. Leveraging an extensive dataset comprising over 100 bacterial sequences across diverse species and genera, I endeavor to uncover correlations between various parameters to achieve this goal. </p>
        <p>Furthermore, I am fascinated by the interplay between viral evolution, infection, and bacterial speciation. While bacteria and viruses share a common ancestor, I am intrigued by the potential role of viral intervention in driving bacterial speciation and genetic diversification. </p>
        <p>Lastly, I aim to investigate the correlation between multidrug resistance exhibited by certain bacteria and the aforementioned research objectives. By integrating these pursuits, I seek to gain a comprehensive understanding of the intricate interplay between bacterial immunity, viral evolution, and genetic adaptation, paving the way for novel insights into microbial interactions and evolution. </p>
